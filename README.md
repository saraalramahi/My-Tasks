## What observation or question do you have about what you have learned so far ?

I observed that creating a complete HTML page with structure and styling requires attention to detail, especially when organizing elements and applying consistent CSS. I also realized how important it is to separate content from style for better clarity and maintainability. One question I still have is how to make the design fully responsive on all screen sizes.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?

It took me around 1.5 to 2 hours to complete the assignment. I initially expected it to take about one hour, but I spent extra time making sure the layout and design looked good.
